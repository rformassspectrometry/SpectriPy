# Introduction

This document provides detailed installation and configuration instructions for
the [*SpectriPy*](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/SpectriPy)
package. For first time R users see also section @sec-first in the appendix.


# Installation

## System requirements

*SpectriPy* relies on, and extends, the
[*reticulate*](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) package for
interoperability between Python and R. For installation of *SpectriPy*, Python
needs to be installed on the system. See also the [Install Python
Packages](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html)
documentation from the *reticulate* package for information on installing
Python. Ideally *miniconda* should be installed on the system. The code below
shows how *miniconda* can be installed with the *reticulate* package (which
needs to be first installed with `install.package("reticulate")` if not already
available):

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("reticulate")
reticulate::install_miniconda()
```


## SpectriPy pre-requisites and installation instructions

### Installing Bioconductor

Bioconductor is required to install SpectriPy, as described below and from
source [https://bioconductor.org/install/](https://bioconductor.org/install/).

The current release of Bioconductor is version 3.20; it works with R version
4.4.0. Users of older R and Bioconductor must update their installation to take
advantage of new features and to access packages that have been added to
Bioconductor since the last release.

The development version of Bioconductor is version 3.21; it works with R version
4.5.0. More recent ‘devel’ versions of R (if available) will be supported during
the next Bioconductor release cycle.

Once R has been installed, get the latest version of Bioconductor by starting R
and entering the following commands.

It may be possible to change the Bioconductor version of an existing
installation; see the *Changing version* section of the BiocManager vignette.

Details, including instructions to install additional packages and to update,
find, and troubleshoot are provided below. A devel version of Bioconductor is
available. There are good reasons for using `BiocManager::install()` for
managing Bioconductor resources.

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.20")
```

### Installing SpectriPy

Since *SpectriPy* is currently still in development, you will need the *remotes*
package to install it from GitHub. If you do not have the *remotes* package yet,
you can install it using the following command:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("remotes")
```

To install the *SpectriPi* package use

```{r}
#| eval: false
BiocManager::install("RforMassSpectrometry/SpectriPy")
```

### Check installation completed

The status of installation can be easily checked by starting R and entering the
following commands.

This command loads the *SpectriPy* package, if correct installed.

```{r}
library(SpectriPy)
```

# Appendix

## Installation instructions for first-time R users{#sec-first}

Instructions to install R and RStudio for the first time are described below,
from source
[https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages2.html](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages2.html).

## Installing R and RStudio

To get started with R, you need to acquire your own copy. This appendix will
show you how to download R as well as RStudio, a software application that makes
R easier to use. You’ll go from downloading R to opening your first R session.

Both R and RStudio are free and easy to download.

### How to Download and Install R

R is maintained by an international team of developers who make the language
available through the web page of The Comprehensive R Archive Network. The top
of the web page provides three links for downloading R. Follow the link that
describes your operating system: Windows, Mac, or Linux.

#### Windows

To install R on Windows, click the “Download R for Windows” link. Then click the
“base” link. Next, click the first link at the top of the new page. This link
should say something like “Download R 3.0.3 for Windows,” except the `3.0.3`
will be replaced by the most current version of R. The link downloads an
installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for
Windows. Run this program and step through the installation wizard that
appears. The wizard will install R into your program files folders and place a
shortcut in your Start menu. Note that you’ll need to have all of the
appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.

#### Mac

To install R on a Mac, click the “Download R for Mac” link. Next, click on the
`R-3.0.3` package link (or the package link for the most current release of
R). An installer will download to guide you through the installation process,
which is very easy. The installer lets you customize your installation, but the
defaults will be suitable for most users. I’ve never found a reason to change
them. If your computer requires a password before installing new progams, you’ll
need it here.

> **Binaries Versus Source**
>
> R can be installed from precompiled binaries or built from source on any
> operating system. For Windows and Mac machines, installing R from binaries is
> extremely easy. The binary comes preloaded in its own installer. Although you
> can build R from source on these platforms, the process is much more
> complicated and won’t provide much benefit for most users. For Linux systems,
> the opposite is true. Precompiled binaries can be found for some systems, but
> it is much more common to build R from source files when installing on
> Linux. The download pages on [CRAN’s website](https://cran.r-project.org/)
> provide information about building R from source for the Windows, Mac, and
> Linux platforms.

#### Linux

R comes preinstalled on many Linux systems, but you’ll want the newest version
of R if yours is out of date. The [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/)
provides files to build R from source on Debian, Redhat, SUSE, and Ubuntu
systems under the link “Download R for Linux.” Click the link and then follow
the directory trail to the version of Linux you wish to install on. The exact
installation procedure will vary depending on the Linux system you use. CRAN
guides the process by grouping each set of source files with documentation or
README files that explain how to install on your system.

> **32-bit Versus 64-bit**
>
> R comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Which should you use? In most
> cases, it won’t matter. Both versions use 32-bit integers, which means they
> compute numbers to the same numerical precision. The difference occurs in the
> way each version manages memory. 64-bit R uses 64-bit memory pointers, and
> 32-bit R uses 32-bit memory pointers. This means 64-bit R has a larger memory
> space to use (and search through).  As a rule of thumb, 32-bit builds of R are
> faster than 64-bit builds, though not always. On the other hand, 64-bit builds
> can handle larger files and data sets with fewer memory management
> problems. In either version, the maximum allowable vector size tops out at
> around 2 billion elements. If your operating system doesn’t support 64-bit
> programs, or your RAM is less than 4 GB, 32-bit R is for you. The Windows and
> Mac installers will automatically install both versions if your system
> supports 64-bit R.

### Using R

R isn’t a program that you can open and start using, like Microsoft Word or
Internet Explorer. Instead, R is a computer language, like C, C++, or UNIX. You
use R by writing commands in the R language and asking your computer to
interpret them. In the old days, people ran R code in a UNIX terminal window—as
if they were hackers in a movie from the 1980s. Now almost everyone uses R with
an application called RStudio, and I recommend that you do, too.

> **R and UNIX**
>
> You can still run R in a UNIX or BASH window by typing the command:
>
> `R`
>
> which opens an R interpreter. You can then do your work and close the
> interpreter by running q() when you are finished.

### RStudio

RStudio is an application like Microsoft Word—except that instead of helping you
write in English, RStudio helps you write in R. I use RStudio throughout the
book because it makes using R much easier. Also, the RStudio interface looks the
same for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. That will help me match the book to your
personal experience.

You can download [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) for
free. Just click the “Download RStudio” button and follow the simple
instructions that follow. Once you’ve installed RStudio, you can open it like
any other program on your computer—usually by clicking an icon on your desktop.

> **The R GUIs**
>
> Windows and Mac users usually do not program from a terminal window, so the
> Windows and Mac downloads for R come with a simple program that opens a
> terminal-like window for you to run R code in. This is what opens when you
> click the R icon on your Windows or Mac computer. These programs do a little
> more than the basic terminal window, but not much. You may hear people refer
> to them as the Windows or Mac R GUIs.

When you open RStudio, a window appears with three panes in it, as in Figure 1.
The largest pane is a console window. This is where you’ll run your R code and
see results. The console window is exactly what you’d see if you ran R from a
UNIX console or the Windows or Mac GUIs. Everything else you see is unique to
RStudio. Hidden in the other panes are a text editor, a graphics window, a
debugger, a file manager, and much more. You’ll learn about these panes as they
become useful throughout the course of this book.  The RStudio IDE for R.

> **Do I still need to download R?**
>
> Even if you use RStudio, you’ll still need to download R to your
> computer. RStudio helps you use the version of R that lives on your computer,
> but it doesn’t come with a version of R on its own.

### Opening R

Now that you have both R and RStudio on your computer, you can begin using R by
opening the RStudio program. Open RStudio just as you would any program, by
clicking on its icon or by typing “RStudio” at the Windows Run prompt.
