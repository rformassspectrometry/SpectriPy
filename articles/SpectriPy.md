# Enabling integration of Python libraries and R packages for combined mass spectrometry data analysis

**Compiled**: Mon Nov 24 09:37:25 2025

**Note**: since version 0.99.6 *SpectriPy* uses the newer, recommended
approach to install and configure required Python libraries (i.e.,
through *reticulate*’s
[`py_require()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_require.html)
functionality). This affects also the way a pre-defined Python
environment can be used. See section [Startup and Python
configuration](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/articles/detailed-installation-configuration.html#sec-python)
in the *Detailed information on installation and configuration* vignette
for updated information.

## Introduction

Powerful software libraries for mass spectrometry (MS) data are
available in both Python and R, covering specific and sometimes distinct
aspects in the analysis of proteomics and metabolomics data. R’s
*reticulate* package converts basic data types between Python and R and
enables a seamless interoperability of both programming languages. The
*SpectriPy* package extends *reticulate* allowing to translate MS data
data structures between R and Python, specifically, between R’s
`Spectra` objects and Python MS data structures from the
[*matchms*](https://github.com/matchms/matchms) and
[*spectrum_utils*](https://github.com/bittremieux-lab/spectrum_utils)
Python libraries. In addition, functionality from Python’s *matchms*
library is directly wrapped into R functions allowing a seamless
integration into R based workflows. *SpectriPy* thus enables powerful
proteomics or metabolomics analysis workflows combining the strengths of
Python and R MS libraries.

This vignette provides information on how to share and translate MS data
structures between R and Python to enable combined Python and R-based
analysis workflows. For an example use case analysis, see the *SpectriPy
tutorial: Annotation of LC-MS/MS spectra* vignette.

## System requirements

The [*reticulate*](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package
enables a seamless integration of Python with R by translating the core
data structures between the two programming languages and sharing a
Python (respectively R) runtime environment, including shared variables,
that can be accessed from the other programming language. If the
*reticulate* package is not already available, it will be installed
during the installation of *SpectriPy*. Alternatively, it can be
installed using `install.packages("reticulate")`.

The *SpectriPy* package builds on *reticulate* providing in addition the
functionality to translate data structures for MS data between the two
languages. Specifically, the package translates between R’s `Spectra`
objects (from the
*[Spectra](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.23/Spectra)* package) and
Python’s `matchms.Spectrum` and `spectrum_utils.spectrum.MsmsSpectrum`
objects from the [*matchms*](https://github.com/matchms/matchms) and
[*spectrum_utils*](https://github.com/bittremieux-lab/spectrum_utils)
Python libraries, respectively.

## Installation

If the *BiocManager* package is not already available, please install it
with `install.packages("BiocManager")`. As a system dependency, the
package requires Python (version \>= 3.12) to be available. During
package installation, *SpectriPy* will by default install all required
Python libraries automatically. See section [Startup and Python
configuration](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/articles/detailed-installation-configuration.html#sec-python)
in the *Detailed information on installation and configuration* vignette
for information on manual library installation or usage of a pre-defined
or system Python environment. See section [Fixing package installation
or loading
problems](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/articles/detailed-installation-configuration.html#sec-fix)
in the *Detailed information on installation and configuration* vignette
for some hints how to solve package installation or loading problems.

To install the package use the code below:

``` r

install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("SpectriPy")
```

## Translating data structures between R and Python

This section describes how MS data is being converted between R and
Python to enable analyses combining both programming/analysis languages
and accessing the same shared MS data. The first two sections describe
how MS data can be converted between R and Python. See also section
[Section 4.4](#sec-backend) for a more elegant approach and improved
integration with [*Spectra*](https://)-based workflows in R.

### Library loading and system setup

Below we load all required packages. By loading *SpectriPy*, the package
will evaluate if the required Python libraries (i.e., *matchms* version
\>= 0.1, *spectrum_utils* version \>= 0.3.2 and *numpy* version \>= 2.2)
are available. If they are not available, *SpectriPy* will install them
using functionality from the *reticulate* R package. See section
[Startup and Python
configuration](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/articles/detailed-installation-configuration.html#sec-python)
in the *Detailed information on installation and configuration* vignette
for more configuration options of *SpectriPy*.

The *reticulate* package will be loaded by *SpectriPy*, ensuring the
R/Python integration provided by that package to be available as well.
To better discriminate between R and Python code chunks, we add the
comment `#' R session:` or `#' Python session:` to label the R and
Python code chunks, respectively.

``` r

#' R session:

library(Spectra)
library(SpectriPy)
```

### Converting MS data from R to Python

In this section we show how MS data can be converted from R to Python.
Below we first define the name and path of a data file in mzML format
(provided by the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("MsDataHub")` package) and load
that data as an R `Spectra` object. We thus first ensure that the
package *MsDataHub* is installed. If the line below results in an error
you need to first install *MsDataHub* using
`BiocManager::install("MsDataHub")`.

``` r

stopifnot(require("MsDataHub"))
```

    Loading required package: MsDataHub

Next, we define the file path to the test file and load the data as a
`Spectra` object in R.

``` r

#' R session:

#' Loading the data from a mzML file as a `Spectra` object
library(MsDataHub)
fl <- MsDataHub::PestMix1_DDA.mzML()
mzml_r <- Spectra(fl)
```

We next restrict the data to MS level 2 and remove spectra with less
than 3 (fragment) peaks.

``` r

#' R session:

#' Restrict to MS level 2 spectra
mzml_r <- filterMsLevel(mzml_r, 2)
mzml_r <- mzml_r[lengths(mzml_r) >= 3]
mzml_r
```

This `Spectra` object can now be converted to equivalent data structures
in Python using the
[`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function:

``` r

#' R session:

#' Convert the R Spectra to a list of Python matchms.Spectrum objects
tmp <- rspec_to_pyspec(mzml_r)
```

The `tmp` variable is now a Python list of `matchms.Spectrum` objects:

``` r

#' R session:

#' Class of the converted variable
class(tmp)
```

    [1] "python.builtin.list"   "python.builtin.object"

``` r

#' First element
class(tmp[1])
```

    [1] "matchms.Spectrum.Spectrum" "python.builtin.object"    

Note that this Python data structure is now stored within the R session.
Therefore, we have two full copies of the data in memory, i.e., an R
`Spectra` object and a Python `matchms.Spectrum` object (see Section
[Section 4.4](#sec-backend) for an alternative to avoid multiple data
copies). We can access the variable from the associated Python
environment through *reticulate*’s special `r` attribute using
`r.<variable name in R>`.

``` python
#' Python session:

#' Access the Python data structure stored in the R session
r.tmp
```

While it is thus possible to access the variable, it is suggested, and
has also performance advantages, if the Python data is stored directly
in the Python environment. Similar to the special `r` attribute,
*reticulate* provides the `py` variable in R that allows access to the
main Python environment associated with the R session. Attributes can be
assigned to the Python environment with the
[`py_set_attr()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_set_attr.html)
function. We repeat our data conversion operation but assign the result
to a Python attribute `"mzml_py"`:

``` r

#' R session:

#' Assign the data to a variable in the Python environment
py_set_attr(py, "mzml_py", rspec_to_pyspec(mzml_r))
names(py)
```

    [1] "mzml_py" "r"      

We can now access this data directly from within Python:

``` python
#' Python session:

#' Data type of the variable:
type(mzml_py)
```

    <class 'list'>

``` python
#' The length of the list:
len(mzml_py)
```

    2243

``` python
#' Data type of the first element:
type(mzml_py[0])
```

    <class 'matchms.Spectrum.Spectrum'>

``` python
#' Intensities of the first spectrum:
mzml_py[0].peaks.intensities
```

    array([0.04827657, 0.09725399, 0.05769959])

This allows us to analyze and process the MS data directly in Python. As
an example we load the *matchms.filtering* library and scale the
intensity values of each spectrum with the
[`normalize_intensities()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/filterSpectriPy.md)
function such that their total sum is 1.

``` python
#' Python session:

import matchms.filtering as mms_filt

#' Iterate over the Spectrum list and scale the intensities
for i in range(len(mzml_py)):
    mzml_py[i] = mms_filt.normalize_intensities(mzml_py[i])

#' Intensities for the first spectrum
mzml_py[0].peaks.intensities
```

    array([0.49639679, 1.        , 0.59328767])

We can also access the changed data from R. The
[`py_get_attr()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_get_attr.html)
function can be used to retrieve the variable with the changed Python
data. Through the *reticulate* package it is then also possible to call
attributes and Python functions directly from R. To extract the
intensities of the first spectrum we can use the same code as above,
just replacing `.` with `$`. Note also that, since the variable returned
by
[`py_get_attr()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_get_attr.html)
is a Python object, we need to use index `0` to access the first
element.

``` r

#' R session:

#' Access the intensities of the first spectrum
py_get_attr(py, "mzml_py")[0]$peaks$intensities
```

    [1] 0.4963968 1.0000000 0.5932877

Note that with the
[`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function, we created a copy of the original data in Python. We have thus
now two variables, the `mzml_r` variable in R with the original,
unchanged, intensity values, and the `mzml_py` attribute in Python with
the scaled intensity values. To get the processing results back to R we
need to convert the data from Python to R. This can be done with the
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function which translates Python MS data structures into an R `Spectra`
object (see the following [Section 4.3](#sec-py-to-r) section for more
information). A more elegant way is to use the `MsBackendPy` backend for
R’ `Spectra` objects (see Section [Section 4.4](#sec-backend)).

With *reticulate* we can use the `py` special variable in R to access
attributes defined in the associated Python environment. Similarly,
*reticulate* defines an attribute `r` in the Python session that allows
to access variables in R. When variables are accessed this way, they are
automatically converted to the corresponding data types in the other
programming language if an
[`r_to_py()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/r-py-conversion.html)
method (or
[`py_to_r()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/r-py-conversion.html)
method) is implemented for them. Such methods are defined for the basic
data types, so, when accessing for example the `fl` R variable from
Python, it is converted from the R `character` data type to the
equivalent Python `str` data type:

``` python
#' Python session:

#' Access the `fl` variable from the R session:
r.fl
```

    '/github/home/.cache/R/ExperimentHub/4585242f8db_7861'

``` python
type(r.fl)
```

    <class 'str'>

*SpectriPy* implements an
[`r_to_py()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/r-py-conversion.html)
method for `Spectra` objects, so, when `Spectra` objects are accessed
from Python, they are also automatically translated to a Python list of
`matchms.Spectrum` objects:

``` python
#' Python session:

#' Access the `Spectra` object with the original data from R; the data
#' gets directly translated on-the-fly
r.mzml_r
```

While this automatic conversion is convenient in some cases, the manual
translation with
[`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
and
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
is preferred, as it allows to configure the handling of the spectra
variables (i.e. metadata) and avoids eventual repeated translation of
the data.

### Converting MS data from Python to R

To show conversion of MS data from Python to R, we import a test data
file in MGF format using the Python *matchms* library. This MGF file is
provided within the *SpectriPy* package so we first define its file name
and path in R.

``` r

#' R session:

f_mgf <- system.file("extdata", "mgf", "test.mgf", package = "SpectriPy")
```

We next load the required Python library and import the data in Python.
We can access the variable (defined in the R session) with the file name
to import the data from through the `r.<variable name>`.

``` python
#' Python session

import matchms
from matchms.importing import load_from_mgf

mgf_py = list(load_from_mgf(r.f_mgf))
mgf_py
```

The MS data from the MGF is now loaded in Python as a list of
`matchms.Spectrum` objects. We can also directly access this variable
from the R session through `py$<variable name in Python>`. Below we
access the first spectrum in that list:

``` r

#' R session:

#' Access the first spectrum
py$mgf_py[[1]]
```

    Spectrum(precursor m/z=259.06, 3 fragments between 213.1 and 259.1)

The data is thus provided in a *matchms.Spectrum* object. We extract the
*m/z* and intensity peak matrix from that spectrum using the built-in
functionality from the *reticulate* package that allows to call Python
functions from R or translate between basic data types. As an example we
below get the `peaks` attribute from the first spectrum and convert that
to a Python `numpy` array. This array can then be translated to an R
`matrix` with the
[`py_to_r()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/r-py-conversion.html)
function (see also the [*Calling Python from
R*](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html)
vignette from the *reticulate* package for examples on accessing data
from Python):

``` r

#' R session:

#' Extract the peaks matrix from the first spectrum
py_to_r(py$mgf_py[[1]]$peaks$to_numpy)
```

             [,1]       [,2]
    [1,] 213.0546   754969.6
    [2,] 241.0495  1058878.8
    [3,] 259.0601 20211204.0

While such functionality can thus be used to extract the MS data from
Python, it is for MS data analysis in R more convenient to transform the
full MS data to an R `Spectra` object using *SpectriPy*’s
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function. Note that below we use the
[`py_get_attr()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_get_attr.html)
function to get the Python variable with the MS data instead of
`py$mgf_py`. Accessing the Python attribute through `py$mgf_py`
immediately translates the Python list into an R `list` through the
default
[`py_to_r()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/r-py-conversion.html)
function and
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
thus iterates over the R `list` (in R). With
[`py_get_attr()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_get_attr.html)
the attribute is accessed in its native Python data type and
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
hence iterates over the data in Python, which has a minimal performance

The full MS data is thus now available as a `Spectra` object. Note
however that with
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
the complete MS data gets **copied**. We have now two (detached)
variables containing the same MS data, one in R and one in Python.

### Using a dedicated MS data *backend* for MS data in Python

An alternative, and more elegant, approach to avoid keeping multiple
copies of spectral objects (i.e., `Spectra`, `matchms.Spectrum`) in
memory, is to use a dedicated data *backend* for the `Spectra` object.
This allows direct access of MS data in Python from R without having an
additional copy in R. The R’s `Spectra` object separates by design the
functionality to analyze MS data from the code to *represent* or
retrieve the MS data, which is provided by dedicated data *backends*.
These allow for example to import MS data from different file formats,
or to store and access the data with different storage modes,
respectively (see also [this
tutorial](https://jorainer.github.io/SpectraTutorials/articles/Spectra-backends.html)
for more information). The *SpectriPy* packages defines such a backend,
the `MsBackendPy`, that allows to directly access MS data stored in
Python (in their respective data formats).

As an example we create below a `Spectra` object for the MS data (in
Python) previously imported from the MGF file (i.e. `"mgf_py"`) and
using the `MsBackendPy` as the data `source` (i.e., backend).

``` r

#' R session:

#' Create a Spectra object with a MsBackendPy backend for the
#' attribute "mgf_py"
mgf <- Spectra("mgf_py", source = MsBackendPy())
mgf
```

    MSn data (Spectra) with 100 spectra in a MsBackendPy backend:
    Data stored in the "mgf_py" variable in Python

In contrast to using the
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function, no data was copied or converted by this call. The `Spectra`
object (through its backend) does only keep a *reference* to the
original data attribute in Python, but no data. Data is retrieved and
translated on-the-fly each time it is requested from the `Spectra`
object. Thus, calling e.g.,
[`msLevel()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/protgenerics.html) or
[`intensity()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/protgenerics.html)
causes the backend to iterate over the MS data in Python, extract the
respective information, translate it and return it to the user.

``` r

While the performance is a little lower, compared to translating all
data to R using the
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function, this approach is much more memory efficient, because no
additional copies of MS data are generated and only the MS data
currently required for a certain analysis task is loaded and translated
at a time.

Also, because data is always retrieved on-the-fly from Python, any
changes to the MS data attribute in Python are also immediately
reflected in the respective `Spectra` object. To illustrate this we
below scale the intensities of the mass peaks in Python:

``` python
#' Python session:

#' Scale intensities
for i in range(len(mgf_py)):
    mgf_py[i] = mms_filt.normalize_intensities(mgf_py[i])
```

The intensities retrieved from the `Spectra` object are now also scaled.

``` r

#' R session:

#' Get intensities after scaling the intensities in Python:
intensity(mgf)
```

While we created a `Spectra` object from an existing data object in
Python, it is similarly possible change the backend of a `Spectra`
object to a `MsBackendPy`. This follows the general concept of `Spectra`
objects to support changing between data representations, respectively
backends, at any time. The first data set in this vignette was imported
from mzML files:

``` r

#' R session:

mzml_r

This `Spectra` object uses the `MsBackedMzR` backend as data
representation. We can change the backend of `Spectra` objects using the
[`setBackend()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/backendInitialize.html)
function. Thus, below we change the backend to `MsBackendPy`, specifying
also the name of the variable in Python that should be used to store the
data.

``` r

#' R session:

mzml_r <- setBackend(mzml_r, backend = MsBackendPy(),
                     pythonVariableName = "mzml_p")
mzml_r
```

    MSn data (Spectra) with 2243 spectra in a MsBackendPy backend:
    Data stored in the "mzml_p" variable in Python
    Processing:
     Filter: select MS level(s) 2 [Mon Nov 24 09:37:37 2025]
     Switch backend from MsBackendMzR to MsBackendPy [Mon Nov 24 09:37:45 2025] 

This converted all the MS data of the `mzml_r` `Spectra` object to
Python objects and assigned these to the Python variable with the name
`"mzml_p"`. The resulting `Spectra` object uses now a `MsBackendPy`
backend which keeps only the reference to the Python variable but no
data. The size of the `Spectra` object is thus very small.

``` r

#' R session:

print(object.size(mzml_r), units = "MB")
```

    0 Mb

And accessing the data will retrieve and convert the data from the
referenced Python objects:

``` r

#' R session:

mz(mzml_r)
```

And all data can also be accessed in Python:

``` python
#' Python session:

len(mzml_p)
```

    2243

``` python
mzml_p[0].peaks.mz
```

    array([ 55.9353447 ,  78.95068359, 138.01589966])

In addition to the MS data (i.e., the *m/z* and intensity values),
[`setBackend()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/backendInitialize.html)
will also convert core general spectra variables and store them in the
Python MS data structure as spectrum related metadata. By default, only
a limited set of spectra variables, the ones with the direct counterpart
in Python, are translated. These are for the *matchms* library:

``` r

#' R session:

spectraVariableMapping("matchms")
```

                     precursorMz           precursorIntensity
                  "precursor_mz"        "precursor_intensity"
                 precursorCharge                        rtime
                        "charge"             "retention_time"
                 collisionEnergy      isolationWindowTargetMz
              "collision_energy" "isolation_window_target_mz"
                         msLevel
                      "ms_level" 

with the names being the spectra variable names in R and the values the
names of the respective metadata fields in Python. The *spectrum_utils*
library supports only few, fixed, variables:

``` r

#' R session:

spectraVariableMapping("spectrum_utils")
```

           precursorMz    precursorCharge              rtime          scanIndex
        "precursor_mz" "precursor_charge"   "retention_time"       "identifier" 

The spectra variables that have been transferred to Python with the
[`setBackend()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/backendInitialize.html)
call above are:

``` r

#' R session:

spectraVariableMapping(mzml_r)
```

                     precursorMz           precursorIntensity
                  "precursor_mz"        "precursor_intensity"
                 precursorCharge                        rtime
                        "charge"             "retention_time"
                 collisionEnergy      isolationWindowTargetMz
              "collision_energy" "isolation_window_target_mz"
                         msLevel
                      "ms_level" 

Thus, only some of the variables from the original `Spectra` object are
now available after changing the backend to `MsBackendPy`. However,
since *matchms* supports additional, arbitrary, metadata fields, it is
also possible to convert and transfer other spectra variables with
`MsBackendPy`. As an example, we below import data from an MGF.

``` r

#' R session:

library(MsBackendMgf)
sps <- Spectra(system.file("extdata", "mgf", "test.mgf",
                           package = "SpectriPy"), source = MsBackendMgf())
```

    Start data import from 1 files ... done

``` r

spectraVariables(sps)
```

     [1] "msLevel"                 "rtime"
     [3] "acquisitionNum"          "scanIndex"

    [19] "SMILES"                  "INCHI"
    [21] "NAME"                   

There are thus also spectra variables, such as `"SMILES"` and `"INCHI"`
that are not part of the default `spectraVariableMapping("matchms")` and
would thus not be converted/transferred by default when changing to a
`MsBackendPy`. We can however use the `spectraVariableMapping` parameter
with
[`setBackend()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/backendInitialize.html)
to define which spectra variables should be transferred. The parameter
takes a named character with names being the names of the spectra
variables to transfer and values the names that should be used for the
metadata in Python. We use the
[`spectraVariableMapping()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/Spectra/man/spectraVariableMapping.html)
function to append the mapping for the spectra variables `"SMILES"` and
`"INCHI"` to the default one.

``` r

#' R session:

mp <- spectraVariableMapping("matchms", c(SMILES = "smiles", INCHI = "inchi"))
mp
```

                     precursorMz           precursorIntensity
                  "precursor_mz"        "precursor_intensity"
                 precursorCharge                        rtime
                        "charge"             "retention_time"
                 collisionEnergy      isolationWindowTargetMz
              "collision_energy" "isolation_window_target_mz"
                         msLevel                       SMILES
                      "ms_level"                     "smiles"
                           INCHI
                         "inchi" 

We pass this character vector to the
[`setBackend()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/backendInitialize.html)
call.

``` r

#' R session:

sps <- setBackend(sps, backend = MsBackendPy(),
                  pythonVariableName = "sps_p",
                  spectraVariableMapping = mp)

```

See also the next section for more information on the mapping between
`Spectra`’s spectra variables and *matchms* metadata.

The `MsBackendPy` has full *read/write* support, i.e., it allows to add
new spectra variables or change existing spectra and/or peaks variables
through the available replacement methods `spectraData()<-`,
`peaksData()<-`, `intensity()<-`, `mz()<-` and `$<-`. Currently, this
operations change however the full MS data of the associated Python
variable. Thus, even if for example only the retention times are
replaced using `$rtime<-`, the (full!) data is first loaded from Python
to R, the retention time values are then replaced and finally the full
data (spectra and peaks variables) are again stored to the associated
Python variable. Replacement operations are thus quite memory demanding.

### Conversion of spectra variables

Conversion of the MS peaks data (i.e. the *m/z* and intensity values) is
always performed by the
[`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
and
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
functions. But next to the peaks data, also additional information are
available for individual spectra. In R/*Spectra* these variables are
called *spectra variables* while in *matchms* they are stored as a
*metadata* attribute to a `matchms.Spectrum` object. The *SpectriPy*
package defines a core set of spectra variables that are by default
converted by the
[`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
and
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function. These default variables can be accessed using the
[`defaultSpectraVariableMapping()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function:

``` r

#' R session:

#' List the *default* spectra variable mapping in R and python, respectively
defaultSpectraVariableMapping()
```

                     precursorMz           precursorIntensity
                  "precursor_mz"        "precursor_intensity"
                 precursorCharge                        rtime
                        "charge"             "retention_time"
                 collisionEnergy      isolationWindowTargetMz
              "collision_energy" "isolation_window_target_mz"
                         msLevel
                      "ms_level" 

These variables, if present in the respective data object, are
transferred (and renamed) to the MS data structure of the other
programming language. The names of this character vector represent the
name of the spectra variable in the `Spectra` object, the elements
(values) the names of the respective metadata keys in Python’s
`matchms.Spectrum` class. This default mapping thus transfers for
example the
[`precursorMz()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/protgenerics.html)
spectra variable of R to the `"precursor_mz"` spectrum metadata in
Python (and *vice versa*). Note that any spectra variable or metadata
**not** being part of such a `mapping` will be ignored and hence not
converted.

Below we inspect the available metadata in the `matchms.Spectrum`
objects that were imported from the MGF file.

``` python
#' Python session:

#' Available metadata for the first spectrum
mgf_py[0].metadata.keys()
```

    dict_keys(['title', 'pepmassint', 'charge', 'smiles', 'inchi', 'ms_level', 'compound_name', 'precursor_mz'])

Several additional metadata variables, such as `"smiles"`, `"inchi"` or
`"compound_name"`, not part of the default variables, are available. To
transfer also these, we create below a custom mapping adding in addition
also a mapping for these 3 variables:

``` r

#' R session:

#' Add mapping for additional spectra variables to the default mapping in R and
#' python, respectively
map <- c(defaultSpectraVariableMapping(), smiles = "smiles",
         inchi = "inchi", name = "compound_name")
map
```

                     precursorMz           precursorIntensity
                  "precursor_mz"        "precursor_intensity"
                 precursorCharge                        rtime
                        "charge"             "retention_time"
                 collisionEnergy      isolationWindowTargetMz
              "collision_energy" "isolation_window_target_mz"
                         msLevel                       smiles
                      "ms_level"                     "smiles"
                           inchi                         name
                         "inchi"              "compound_name" 

Such custom mapping can be passed with the parameter `mapping` to the
[`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
(and also the
[`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md))
function which will then convert the full data to R.

``` r

#' R session:

#' Convert the Python MS data structures to an R `Spectra`
mgf_r <- pyspec_to_rspec(py_get_attr(py, "mgf_py"), mapping = map)
spectraVariables(mgf_r)
```

     [1] "msLevel"                 "rtime"
     [3] "acquisitionNum"          "scanIndex"
     [5] "dataStorage"             "dataOrigin"

    [19] "inchi"                   "name"                   

The respective metadata values have thus been added as new spectra
variables to our `Spectra` object and can also be extracted:

When using a `MsBackendPy`, all metadata attributes from the
`matchms.Spectrum` objects can be accessed and extracted with the
[`spectraData()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/protgenerics.html)
function. The
[`spectraVariables()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/protgenerics.html)
function lists all available columns:

``` r

#' R session:

#' List available spectra variables
spectraVariables(mgf)
```

     [1] "msLevel"                 "rtime"

We thus have already access to e.g. the `"inchi"` variable:

A
[`spectraVariableMapping()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/Spectra/man/spectraVariableMapping.html)
can however be used to rename variables. Below we add for example a
mapping of the `matchms.Spectrum` metadata attribute `"pepmassint"` to
the (core) variable `"precursorIntensity"` using the `MsBackendPy`:

``` r

#' R session:

#' Add mapping for additional spectra variables to the `MsBackendPy`
m <- defaultSpectraVariableMapping()
m["precursorIntensity"] <- "pepmassint"
spectraVariableMapping(mgf) <- m

#' List available spectra variables
spectraVariables(mgf)
```

The
[`r_to_py()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/r-py-conversion.html)
methods do not support additional parameters, thus, in order to use a
similar mapping also with the
[`r_to_py()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/r-py-conversion.html)
method for `Spectra` the *global* spectra variable mapping need to be
changed. See the help of the
[`setSpectraVariableMapping()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
function for more details.

### Combined MS data analysis

With the functionality to translate between R and Python MS data
structures, the *SpectriPy* package enables thus a MS data analysis
combining functionality provided by both R and Python libraries. Some of
the functionality of the *matchms* Python library are directly wrapped
into R functions simplifying their use and inclusion in R-based
workflows (see the help of `compareSpectraPy()` and
[`filterSpectriPy()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/filterSpectriPy.md)
functions). Combined analyses with code chunks in both programming
languages has however the advantage to use the respective functionality
provided by the original package/library.

As a simple use case we calculate below spectra similarities using two
different similarity scores between spectra from the mzML and the MGF
files.

In R we can use the
[`compareSpectra()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ProtGenerics/man/protgenerics.html)
function that by default calculates the normalized dot product
similarity between the compared spectra. The MS data from the mzML file
was processed in Python. To use this data we first create a `Spectra`
object with a `MsBackendPy` backend. For the MS data from the MGF file
we re-use the `mgf` variable, which is also a `Spectra` with a
`MsBackendPy` backend referencing the MS data imported and processed in
Python.

``` r

#' R session:

#' Create a `Spectra` for the scaled MS data in Python
mzml <- Spectra("mzml_py", source = MsBackendPy())

#' Calculate the pairwise similarity between all spectra
sim <- compareSpectra(mzml, mgf, tolerance = 0.1)
dim(sim)
```

    [1] 2243  100

We can calculate the *Cosine Hungarian* similarity score in Python using
the functionality from the *matchms* library. Here we use the *original*
attributes available in Python, i.e. `mzml_py` and `mgf_py`.

``` python
#' Python session:

import matchms.similarity as mms_similarity

#' Calculate similarity scores
scores = matchms.calculate_scores(
    mzml_py, mgf_py, mms_similarity.CosineHungarian(tolerance = 0.1))
```

``` python

#' Extract similarity scores
sim = scores.to_array()["CosineHungarian_score"]
```

Alternatively, we can also directly use any `Spectra` object from R as
the data is converted automatically when accessed from Python. We can
for example use `r.mzml` instead of `mzml_py` in the call above, which
converts the `Spectra` object `mzml` in R to Python before calculating
the similarities.

We can also directly compare the scores calculated using the two
different algorithms.

``` r

#' R session:

#' Plot the similarity scores against each other
plot(sim, py$sim, pch = 21, col = "#000000ce", bg = "#00000060",
     xlab = "Dot product", ylab = "Cosine Hungarian")
grid()
```

### Summary

By translating between R and Python MS data structures, the *SpectriPy*
package enables data analyses that combine functionalities from both
programming language. In terms of (memory) efficiency, usage of
*SpectriPy*’s `MsBackendPy` backend for `Spectra` objects has clear
advantages over the repeated translation and copying of the MS data. See
also section [Section 5.1](#sec-comments) for general comments.

## Appendix

### General comments

- Be careful accessing Python attributes using `py$<attribute name>`:
  base Python data types will be automatically converted to the
  equivalent R data type. For MS data, it might be better to get the
  attributes using the
  [`py_get_attr()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/py_get_attr.html)
  functions.

- Since MS data can be large, it is suggested the user converts MS data
  mostly manually, and only if/when needed, using
  [`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
  and
  [`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md).

- The
  [`rspec_to_pyspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
  and
  [`pyspec_to_rspec()`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/SpectriPy/reference/conversion.md)
  functions **copy** the data while transferring. Thus, there will be
  eventually two (detached) copies of the same data in Python and R.

- The `MsBackendPy` backend allows to directly interface MS data from
  Python. Data will be converted on-the-fly, so no additional copies of
  the data exist.

- Be aware that, since the `MsBackendPy` backend does not contain any MS
  data but simply interfaces the MS data in Python, any changes to this
  data in Python affect also the `Spectra` object using that backend.
